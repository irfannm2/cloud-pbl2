# Trial-1

## Overview
Our team agreed to make branches to avoid conflicts when working simultaneously in the same codebase.

## Tasks
- [x] Create Container: Task 1
- [x] Authentication page: Task 2
- [ ] Upload Image: Task 3
- [ ] Start Container: Task 5
- [ ] Stop Container: Task 6
- [ ] Calculate Billing System: Task 7
- [x] List Images: Task 8
- [x] List Containers : Task 9

## To be Fixed
- Task 1: usually after a container created it runs right away --> make the stages of container creating clear (image pull, create container, start, stop) #fixed
- Task 1: add feature to list all the images we have, containers, and which ones are running/not (basically docker desktop recreated)? #not a clean code
- Task 1 : Container and Images list don't have any UI and attrs still not really clean. Make a dictionary to clean each data.
- Task 2 : Create a new page for uploading images from user and auto create.
