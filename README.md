# Trial-1

## Overview
Our team agreed to make branches to avoid conflicts when working simultaneously in the same codebase.

## Tasks
- [x] Create Container: Task 1
- [x] Authentication page: Task 2
- [ ] Upload Image: Task 3
- [ ] Start Container: Task 5
- [ ] Stop Container: Task 6
- [ ] Calculate Billing System: Task 7
- [ ] List Images: Task 7

## To be Fixed
- Task 1: usually after a container created it runs right away --> make the stages of container creating clear (image pull, create container, start, stop) #fixed
- Task 1: add feature to list all the images we have, containers, and which ones are running/not (basically docker desktop recreated)?
